For Javascript coders, here is the day-2 code ideas.

# Beginner level

1. Write a program to find the LCM and HCF of 4 given numbers.
2. Write a program to store grocery list into a text file and to fetch grocery items from file.

Sample Grocery list
Flour => 10 KG
Rice => 10 KG
Sugar => 5 KG
Pulse 1 => 2 KG
Pulse 2 => 2 KG
Pulse 3 =>2 KG
....
....
// So, first ask user how many items and then ask for items and store them to
//file. Once user query file and type Pulse3, then it should return 2 KG.
